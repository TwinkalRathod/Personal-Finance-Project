# Personal-Finance-Project
An interactive Power BI Dashboard created.
I have created this Power BI Dashboard using data about personal finance. I got the data idea from Code Basic's Tutorials. I got a clean dataset and I have done
some transformation using power query.
I have changed currency and Date type.
I have used formula language to find Total Expense, Income and saving.
I have used formula language to find percentage of Expense, Income and saving.
I have found my Cummulative Net Worth using Formula language.
Insights inferred :
1. I need to control my expenses like shopping and EMI.
2. I need to focus on savings.
3. I need to focus on save/spend according to my earning.
  
5. 
6.
